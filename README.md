# mini-git
mini git is a simplified version of Git, developed as a project to demonstrate the core functionalities of version control systems. It allows users to create, manage, and track changes in repositories through commands inspired by Git, but with a more minimalistic approach.

Key features include:

	•	Repository management: Create, open, and manage multiple repositories.
	•	File operations: Add, edit, and remove files within repositories.
	•	Version tracking: Commit changes and restore files or entire projects to previous states.
	•	Snapshot management: Simulate Git’s staging area, committing, and diff operations.
	•	Logs and status checks: View commit history and current file status.

This project simulates essential Git commands like add, commit, restore, diff, and log, offering a lightweight introduction to version control concepts.
